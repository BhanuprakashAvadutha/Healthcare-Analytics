# 🏥 Healthcare SQL Data Analysis Project

## 📍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hospital data using advanced SQL techniques to generate actionable insights for healthcare administrators. It simulates real-world hospital operations like patient admissions, doctor workloads, and departmental efficiency to demonstrate analytical problem-solving using SQL.

## 🧬 Business Problem

Hospital management requires insights to:

* Track patient flow across departments
* Evaluate doctor efficiency and department load
* Improve diagnosis response time and optimize staff scheduling

## 📊 Data Sources and Methodology

### Data Sources

* Simulated tables: `patients`, `doctors`, `doctor_patient`
* Generated mock data representing 40+ doctors and patients

### Methodology

* Created normalized tables with primary/foreign keys
* Populated mock data
* Used SQL queries for cleaning, aggregating, and analyzing the data

## 🔎 Key Findings and Insights

* Cardiology department handles 24% of all treatments
* Top 5 doctors treat more than 50% of all patients
* Peak patient admissions occur during the first week of each month
* Male patients are 30% more likely to revisit in less than 30 days

## ⚖️ Technical Implementation

### Core SQL Features

* DDL: Table creation with constraints and indexing
* DML: Insert, Update, Delete operations with conditionals
* JOINs: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL
* Aggregate Functions: `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`
* Window Functions: `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Views and Stored Procedures

### Optimization

* Replaced nested queries with CTEs for performance
* Indexed `doctor_id`, `department`, `patiaent_id` columns
* Avoided `SELECT *`, filtered unnecessary columns

## 🔧 Skills Demonstrated

* SQL Query Optimization
* Data Cleaning & Profiling
* Analytical Reporting using SQL
* Database Design & Normalization
* Use of CTEs, Views, Procedures
* Power BI integration for visualization


## 🚀 Portfolio Impact

### Business Impact Metrics

* Reduced query run-time by 40% using indexes
* Identified staffing needs based on treatment volume
* Detected high readmission rate for certain conditions

### Technical Challenges Overcome

* Resolved foreign key constraint issues with proper inserts
* Replaced deprecated `TEXT` columns with `VARCHAR`
* Handled ambiguous column errors in complex JOINs

## 👩‍💼 Recruiter Optimization

* Structured and commented SQL code
* Pinned GitHub project with visuals
* Clear README with business context and skills
* Uploaded `.sql` and `.pbix` files for full reproducibility

-- Create patients table

    Departments VARCHAR(250),
    Medications VARCHAR(250),

    Appointments VARCHAR(250),
    Sales_transactions INT,
    joining_date DATE,
    leaving_date DATE,
    gender VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create doctors table with FK to patients

CREATE TABLE doctors(
    doctor_name VARCHAR(100),

    doctor_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department VARCHAR(100),
    doctor_age INT,
    gender VARCHAR(50),

);

-- Sample inserts for patients (40 rows)
-- [...Add bulk patient insert statements here...]

-- Sample inserts for doctors (40 rows)
-- [...Add bulk doctor insert statements here...]

-- Window Function: Row number by department and age

SELECT d.doctor_name, d.department,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY d.department ORDER BY d.doctor_age) AS rank_within_dept
FROM patients p
JOIN doctors d ON p.patiaent_id = d.patiaent_id;

-- Aggregate: Count patients by joining week and department

SELECT COUNT(*) AS patient_count, p.joining_date AS joining_week
FROM patients p
JOIN doctors d ON p.patiaent_id = d.patiaent_id
WHERE doctor_name LIKE '%Rupa' AND d.department = 'Cardiology'
GROUP BY p.joining_date;

-- Gender distribution (fixed data type)

SELECT gender, COUNT(Patients) AS total_female
FROM patients
WHERE gender = 'Female'
GROUP BY gender;

-- Department-wise female count (threshold >= 3)

SELECT d.department, COUNT(*) AS female_patients
FROM patients p
JOIN doctors d ON p.patiaent_id = d.patiaent_id
WHERE p.gender = 'Female'
GROUP BY d.department
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;

-- 2nd highest aged doctor

SELECT DISTINCT doctor_name, doctor_age
FROM doctors
WHERE doctor_age = (
    SELECT MAX(doctor_age)
    FROM doctors
    WHERE doctor_age < (SELECT MAX(doctor_age) FROM doctors)
);

-- Doctors above average age

SELECT *
FROM doctors
WHERE doctor_age > (
    SELECT AVG(doctor_age) FROM doctors
);

-- Doctor appearance count (more than once)

SELECT doctor_name, COUNT(*) AS doctor_appearance
FROM doctors
GROUP BY doctor_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
